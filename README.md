# Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
Machine Learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one world expects.
This course is a machine learning bootcamp from udemy and here are some of the files and workmanship that I learned in this course.

* ## [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/HarryMaringanT/Machine-Learning-Bootcamp/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning)
Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting. *source: wikipedia* 

* ## [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/HarryMaringanT/Machine-Learning-Bootcamp/tree/master/Python%20for%20Data%20Science)
Python is a programming language that is often used for data science. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. *source: wikipedia*
