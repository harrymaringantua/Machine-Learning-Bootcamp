# Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
Machine Learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one world expects.
